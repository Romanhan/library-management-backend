# AI Usage

I used Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI with Claude Sonnet 4.5) as a programming assistant.

## My approach:

- Used AI to understand the project structure
- Asked AI to explain assignment requirements and suggest better implementation approaches
- Got help when stuck on implementation issues (e.g., Task 1 frontend not sending `memberId`)
- Asked for code reviews to identify bugs and inefficiencies
- Learned Spring Data JPA naming conventions for Task 3 optimization

I wrote all code myself. AI served as a guide when I was stuck and as a reviewer to catch issues.
